# Weather API

### 📄 Overview
This project is a dynamic, single-page web application that displays real-time weather information and local prayer times based on the user's location or a selected city. It uses modern JavaScript to fetch, process, and display data fetched from external APIs.

### ✨ Features
- **Location-Based Default**: Automatically detects the user's location to display current and forecast data.

- **City Search (Geocoding):** Allows users to search for and select any city worldwide to view its weather and prayer times.

- **Real-Time Clock:** Displays the current time and date of the selected city's local time zone.

- **Dynamic Background**: Changes the application wallpaper based on the current weather conditions.

- **Detailed Weather Data:** Displays current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and pressure, along with hourly and 5-day forecasts.

- **Accurate Prayer Times:** Fetches accurate daily prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) for the selected location.

- **Visual Icons:** Uses Skycons "Js library" for smooth, animated weather icons.
  
- **API used:** [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for weather and Geolocation API, and [aladhan](https://aladhan.com/) for Prayer Times and Hijri Date.
